## What is OTTR:

OTTR is a set of tools and templates to help you make websites and online courses more easily!

It helps you use [GitHub](https://github.com/) to publish websites and courses for free.


## Benefits of OTTR:

- OTTR is free!
- No software installations needed
- Automatically preview content on GitHub before you publish (not just locally!)
- Automatically check spelling (and customize it!)
- Automatically and periodically check for broken links
- Easily customize branding
- Easily include code (and avoid version difference issues using Docker containers)
- Easily format courses for learning platforms like [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/) 
- Easily update courses! (only edit once and it gets propagated to all locations)

(*Note that you will need to establish a publishing contract with coursera if you want to publish there)
