### `file is not in PNG format`: Google Slides permissions fail

_Error example:_
```
Error in png::readPNG(path, native = TRUE, info = TRUE) :
  file is not in PNG format
Calls: local ... lapply -> FUN -> raster_dpi_width -> attr -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted
Error in Rscript_render(f, render_args, render_meta, add1, add2) :
  Failed to compile <file_name>.Rmd
Calls: local ... <Anonymous> -> render_new_session -> Rscript_render
Execution halted
Error: bookdown::render_book() failed to render the output format 'bookdown::gitbook'.
Execution halted
```
_What does this mean?:_

Your Google Slides presentation you have tried to retrieve a slide from with `ottrpal::include_slide()` is not public. Your Google Slide document must be set to `Anyone with a link`. See [this article for more details.](https://support.wix.com/en/article/setting-permissions-for-google-drive-files-and-folders#:~:text=Settings%20Permissions%20for%20a%20Google,edit%20and%20comment%20as%20well.) The renders will fail if this is not set! See the [setting up images and graphics section](https://github.com/ottrproject/OTTR_Template/wiki/Setting-up-images-and-graphics) for more details.

### `Process completed with exit code 1.`: Spell check/url check/quiz format fail:

Underneath a section that says something like: `**Check spelling/url/quiz errors - fail if too many of them**` you may see something like:
```
Run exit 1
  exit 1
  shell: sh -e {0}
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

This is failing on purpose -- it means that checker has found errors. Return to your pull request page and look for a comment that says something like:
```
⚠️ There are <spelling/quiz/url> errors that need to be addressed. Read this guide for more info.
Download the errors here.
Comment updated at <some_date> with changes from <commit>
```

Click on the `Download the errors here` to see the list of errors and which files they were found in. For help in addressing these errors, click on the `Read this guide for more info` button.

### `CONFLICT (modify/delete)`: Merge conflict fail:

_Error example:_
```
CONFLICT (modify/delete): <file_name> deleted in <branch_name> and modified in HEAD. Version HEAD of <file_name> left in tree.
```

This will often happen when render-preview's git handling doesn't know which changes you are looking to preview. The easiest way to fix this problem is to create a separate pull request that completely deletes the files lists. To do this, follow these steps:

1) Take note of your pull request's number. Go to the pull request page and see what `#number` is posted there.
2) On your GitHub repository, go to `Code` and click on `Branches`.
3) Your pull request's preview is made on a branch named `preview-<number of your pull request> `. Find this branch and click the trash can icon. This will delete the preview branch and hopefully get rid of this error. [Read this](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/github-delete-branch) for more info on how to delete a branch.
4) Re-trigger your GitHub actions run and it should pass.

### `Parser error: while parsing a flow sequence`: _bookdown.yml parse error

If you see an error like this:
```
Run Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', output_format = 'all')"
Error in yaml::yaml.load(..., eval.expr = TRUE) :
  Parser error: while parsing a flow sequence at line 4, column 12 did not find expected ',' or ']' at line 11, column 13
Calls: <Anonymous> ... <Anonymous> -> resolve -> <Anonymous> -> yaml_load -> <Anonymous>
Execution halted
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

It means that the formatting in your `_bookdown.yml` is off. If you forget a comma, or quote, or a `]` this message will appear in the github actions preview run.

Take a careful look at the `_bookdown.yml`. Keep in mind that _bookdown.yml rmd_files spec should look like this (indents, quotes, and commas included in this pattern):

```
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd",
            "01-intro.Rmd",
            "02-chapter_of_course.Rmd",
            "new_file.Rmd",
            "About.Rmd",
            "References.Rmd"]
```
Commit the changes to your `_bookdown.yml` and see if the preview GitHub action runs appropriately.

### `404 error`: GitHub Action link to download and preview `.docx` file is returning a 404 error

If you get a 404 error after clicking the link while attempting to download the `.docx` file from the GitHub Action rendered previews, then add the following code to the end of the `_output.yml` file:

```
bookdown::word_document2:
  toc: true
```

Commit the changes to your `_output.yml` and see if the preview GitHub action runs appropriately. 

### `Error in if (title == x2) return(head) : the condition has length > 1`: Run bookdown render error

If you observe an error like this:

```
Error in if (title == x2) return(head) : the condition has length > 1
Calls: <Anonymous> ... split_chapters -> build -> sub -> is.factor -> prepend_chapter_title
Execution halted
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

Then look at the `GA_Script.Rhtml` file and remove the following `html` frontmatter if it's present:

(at the beginning of the file)

```
  <html>

  <head>
  <title>Title</title>
  </head>

  <body>
```

(at the end of the file)

```
  </body>
  </html>
```
## Content not rendering

Check that the config file is up-to-date. It should look like this: https://github.com/ottrproject/OTTR_Template/blob/main/config_automation.yml.
(be careful to keep your selections for the configuration you would like).
